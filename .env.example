# --- Server-Side Secret Keys ---
# These keys are for server-side use ONLY and must never be exposed to the browser.
# DO NOT prefix them with NEXT_PUBLIC_.
# For production (Vercel), these should be set in the Vercel project settings, NOT in a .env file.
# For local development, they can be placed in .env.local.

# --- Firebase Server-Side Admin Credentials (SPECIAL CASE) ---
# For security and compatibility with Vercel, the Firebase Admin SDK credentials
# are NOT managed through .env files.
#
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# Create a `docs/service-account.json` file as described in the README.md.
# This file is git-ignored and provides the necessary credentials for local server-side actions.
#
# PRODUCTION (Vercel):
# Set the following three environment variables in your Vercel project settings.
# The values come directly from your service-account.json file.
#
# FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
# FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
# FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
